- 👋 Hi, I’m @rammons1
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things cyber to include becoming a cyber-crime analyst, Jr. penetration tester, or cybersecurity specialist . . . but mostly penetration tester. 
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to expand my knowledge on penetration testing technique/methodology as well as learning Python and Bash scripting. Every time I think I have a grasp of the material, I'm exposed to something new!
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything!
- 
- 📫 How to reach me -> right here.
